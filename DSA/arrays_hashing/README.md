# 2026 🚀

This repository documents my 6-month intensive preparation journey (Feb 2026 – Aug 2026) to become job-ready for:

* Data Scientist
* Machine Learning Engineer
* AI Engineer

Target: ₹8–18 LPA roles (Product + Tech companies)

## 📅 Phase 1: Gatekeeper Fortification (DSA + Core Skills)

### 🗓 Day 1 — Arrays & HashMap Fundamentals

Focus:

* Python Basics (Loops, Conditions, Functions)
* Dictionary & Set Mastery
* Time Complexity (O(n) Thinking)
* Writing Engineering-Grade Code (OOP Structure)

---

## ✅ Problems Solved (Day 1)

### 1. Two Sum

* Approach: HashMap (Complement Lookup)
* Time Complexity: O(n)
* Space Complexity: O(n)
* Key Concept: Trade space for time using dictionary

### 2. Contains Duplicate

* Approach: Set for fast membership checking
* Time Complexity: O(n)
* Space Complexity: O(n)
* Key Concept: Early exit optimization

### 3. Valid Anagram

* Approach: Character Frequency Counting (Dictionary)
* Time Complexity: O(n)
* Space Complexity: O(1) (fixed alphabet assumption)
* Key Concept: Frequency map comparison

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Learned

* For loops & conditional logic
* Python dictionaries and `.get()` method
* Sets for O(1) lookup
* Frequency counting pattern
* HashMap-based problem solving
* Clean class-based Python design
* Basic Big-O analysis
